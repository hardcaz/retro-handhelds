# retro-handhelds
welcome to the repo this will contain most of the modern retro handhelds i know  
you guys can add move to this if you guys want  
rules  
1:handheld that does have fantasy console support like chip-8 counts  
2:hardware doesent count unless it is a handheld  
3 hardware that can be made into a handheld(raspberry pi)do count but it has to be a specific handheld (so raspberry pi by itself does not count)
those are the only rules
